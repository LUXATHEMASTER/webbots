# webbots
Experimenting and learning how to build bots.

This file contains multiple bots that I have created in the past. The first folder models containers images that I scraped from getty images. The file gettyimagesscraper.py is the bot that scraped those pictures and stored them in the folder model.

The file ebaywebsitescraper.py is also a webscraper that scrapes the model ,price of IPHONE X phones that are on an ebay webpage.

The twiterbot.py is a twiter bot that takes scraped images and posts them on twiter.The twiter bot makes use of the Twiter Api.

Languages used: Python

FrameWorks: Beautiful Soup Django
